# Minecraft Modding Tutorial
A Minecraft modding tutorial for use on a locked down Windows machine.

We're going to try and set up a development environment on a locked down Windows machine. This tutorial has been tested on Windows 10, but should work on earlier versions too.

We're using *portable versions* of the Java Development Kit and Eclipse so that we can work on machines without needing administrative access, or installing anything on to the computer, for example in a school environment.

1. [Development Environment Setup](dev-environment-setup.md)
2. [Our first example Mod!](example1-mod.md)
3. [Profit!]
* [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
