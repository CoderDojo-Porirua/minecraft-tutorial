# Troubleshooting
## Development Environment Setup
### JDK Unpacking issues
If you see the following issue whilst unpacking the jdk, check the version of the jdk you downloaded matches your operating system.

````
This version of C:\Users\coderdojo\Downloads\jdk\jre\bin\unpack200.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher.

#### What caused it?
Java ran out of memory trying to perform the gradlew task.

#### How do we fix it?
Give Java more memory! :-)
- Add the following line to **%USERNAME%\\.gradle\\gradle.properties** (create the file if it doesn't exist) to allocate more RAM to Gradle. Here we're giving it 2GB.
  - ````org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2G````
  - If you get an error about running out of memory, try one of these options - 1.5GB or 1GB:
  - ````org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1500M````
  - ````org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1000M````

### Eclipse run/debug error

````
Launching Client has encountered a problem.
Variable references empty selection: ${project_loc}
````
#### How do we fix it?
- Make sure youâ€™ve got the project selected in the Package Explorer pane on the left. (Eclipse is stupid sometimes.)
